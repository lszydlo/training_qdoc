# QDoc System: detailed requirements (core variant)

- **Document ID:** QDOC-CORE-REQ
- **Version:** 0.1, 2026-10-06
- **Status:** draft
- **Entity specified:** the QDoc System
- **Size:** 40 use cases, 300 rules

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document is the input for a modelling workshop. It spells out, in the
language of the business, what the QDoc System does with a controlled
document from the first draft to the signature of the last recipient. The
participants read the rules and find the model in them: which things must
change together, which facts are computed, which rules guard a transition,
who is allowed to do what, and what happens as a reaction somewhere else.

The document therefore describes behaviour only. It names no subsystem, no
bounded context, no aggregate and no event; finding them is the work of the
workshop. Each rule has the QDoc System as its subject.

### 1.2 Sources

- [QDoc one-pager, core variant](qdoc-one-pager-core.md): the flow, the
  concepts and the rules in short.
- [QDoc UI prototype](qdoc-ui.prototype.html): the screens of the owner, the
  author, the quality manager and the employee. Where the one-pager is
  silent, the behaviour of the prototype is taken as decided.

### 1.3 Structure

Five sections follow the life of a version: **Preparation**, **Review**,
**Approval**, **Distribution** and **Signing**. Each section holds use
cases. A use case has a name and one sentence saying who needs what. Under
it stands the list of rules the QDoc System keeps while the use case runs,
one statement per rule.

Rules that return in many use cases are written out in each of them: who may
act, in which status, the electronic signature, the audit entry, the
activity entry and the notifications. A use case can then be read, cut out
and modelled without the rest of the document.

### 1.4 Out of scope

- **Reading the logs.** Each use case says which audit entry and which
  activity entry it writes. Who reads the audit log, how the activity log is
  shown, and the rule that nobody edits or deletes an entry are not part of
  the five sections.
- **Delivery of notifications.** A rule says who is told about what; the
  glossary says a notification reaches the action list and the e-mail of the
  user. Wording, timing and retries are not covered.
- **Users and groups.** Creating users, giving levels, managing groups and
  signing in are assumed. Only the reaction to a user joining a group is
  covered.
- **Left out by the one-pager on purpose:** bulk actions, import, templates
  and tags, change control, periodic review, training plans, time limits for
  review and approval, changing approvers during the round, signing on
  behalf, the HR System, controlled export, document links, reporting,
  security events, API, system validation.

## 2. Conventions

- **Modal verbs:** `shall` states a binding rule. Other modal verbs are not
  used in statements.
- **Statement patterns:** `When <event>, the QDoc System shall …` for a
  reaction; `If <unwanted event>, the QDoc System shall reject …` for a
  check; `While <state>, the QDoc System shall …` for something that holds
  during a state; `The QDoc System shall …` for something that holds at
  each moment.
- **Logic:** conditions and lists of alternatives are combined as
  `[A AND B]` and `[A OR B]`, in capitals inside brackets. "Outside
  `[A OR B]`" means neither A nor B.
- **IDs:** each use case has the ID `N-<SECTION>-<NN>`. The section codes
  are `PREP`, `REVW`, `APPR`, `DIST` and `SIGN`. They are sections of this
  document, not subsystems, and differ on purpose from the subsystem codes
  in [QDoc System: structure](qdoc-system-structure.md). Rules carry no ID;
  a rule is referred to by its use case.
- **Version lifecycle.** Statements name the statuses of this figure:

  ```text
  Draft → In review → In approval → Approved → Published → Effective → Archived
    ↑____ reverted ____|__ declined __|                                QDoc: retired
    |_____________ sent for approval without review _____↑
  ```

  A QDoc is `active` or `retired`. A QACK is `to sign`, `overdue`, `signed`
  or `closed`. A suggestion is `open`, `accepted` or `discarded`. An
  attachment has the scan status `quarantine`, `released` or `failed`.

## 3. Preparation

From the first draft to a version ready to be sent on: creating QDocs and
versions, deciding who sees a version, writing the files, attaching PDFs,

## 7. Signing

How a person learns a published version and signs for it: the training the
owner sets, a person's own QACKs, reading the files, the quiz, the signature,
overdue and closed QACKs, and the figures the owner follows.

## 9. Glossary

The name in bold is the only name the statements use.

### The system and its users

- **QDoc System**: the system this document specifies. It supports an
  organisation in preparing, approving, distributing and acknowledging
  quality documents, and keeps the record of who did what and when.
  "System" as an actor in a log means the QDoc System acting by itself.
- **User**: a person with an account in the QDoc System. Each user has one
  level.
- **Level**: employee, author or quality manager.
- **Employee**: the level that reads versions in force and completes QACKs.
- **Author**: the level that also creates QDocs, writes, reviews and
  approves.
- **Quality manager**: the level that does on each QDoc what an owner does,
  and alone publishes, changes an effective date and retires.
- **Group**: a named set of users. Its users are its members.
- **Current date**: the calendar day on which the QDoc System acts.

### QDocs and versions

  (POL, SOP, WI), a hyphen and a number. Numbers run separately for each
  document type, upwards from 1; the **next unused QDoc ID** of a document
  type has the lowest number above each number the type has used.

- **ID**: identifier.
- **Version**: one edition of a QDoc: its files, its people, its version
  settings, its status and its dates.
